    <p class="xxxlarge">Recipe for Disaster</p>
    <p class="xlarge">Recipe for Disaster is the 100th quest released by Jagex, being a sequel to the Cook's Assistant quest. It is composed of 10 parts: the introduction, followed by 8 subquests, then culminating in a grand finale where the player must face-off with the Culinaromancer. The subquests range in difficulty from very easy to very hard. It is intended to be a quest which nearly any member can start, but which only the most accomplished and willing players can complete. It is most known for rewarding the player with the ability to buy Barrows gloves.</p>
